# Futbolito

Table Football (or Foosball) game

I made this little game a few years ago when I was learning to program in java, so the code is terrible bad written and it has many bug and unexpected behaviors, don't expect too much.

I don't have rights for some football team logos that this game uses.

##Wanna play?

When opens the main window type `H` to start the game.

To move the players use:
* Left User:
`V B N M` to select row, `A D` to spin and `W S` to move up or down.
* Right User:
`4 5 6 +` on the number pad to select row and use the arrows in the way `WASD` does.
